## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Electronics & Instruments
- Components: Resistors, Capacitors, Inductors, Diodes, Transistors, SMDs
- Tools: Multi ohm-meter, Soldering Station, Oscilloscopes (CRO, DSO)
- ICs: 555 Timer (Monostable, Bistable, Astable), Digital Adders, Amplifiers

### Microcontroller & Experiments
- **Arduino**: Used `pinMode()`, `digitalWrite()`, `analogWrite()`
- **Experiments**:
  - LED Blink (Basic & 3-LED fade using Potentiometer)
  - Voltage Regulator Circuit with 7806 IC

### Electrical Concepts
- **DC Machines**: Generators, Motors, Back EMF (Eb = NΦPZ / 60A)
- **Circuit Theorems**: Superposition, Thevenin’s, Norton’s, Max Power Transfer
- **Solenoid Design**: Magnetic field, flux, area, force calculated

## 🧪 Engine Test Bed Insights

- **Purpose**: Testing engines outside vehicles for performance and emissions
- **Key Components**: Starter, Alternator, Feed Pump, ECU, Dynamometer, Boom Box, Smoke Meter
- **System Control**: Cam, Crank, Pedal, Ignition, ECU (powered via SMPS)

---

## 🔥 Engine Fundamentals

- **4-Stroke Cycle**: Intake → Compression → Combustion → Exhaust
- **Injection Phases**: Pilot → Main → After → Post (for emission control)
- **Petrol vs Diesel**:
  - Petrol: Needs spark ignition
  - Diesel: Self-ignites under high compression
  - Shift towards BS6 petrol engines for reduced emissions
